        <h2>Overview/Design Statement</h2>
        
    
        <p>IoT is something requires an internet connection, with little to no assistance required from human interaction. When being introduced to the feather huzzah, it made it clear that there is more that can be done with the arduino. The easiest part was the ideation stage. It’s simple to develop the ideas but a whole other level is required to bring your ideas to life. While there is a pandemic actively present during these times, it made sense to gear towards current events.</p>
        
        <p>There was a high fascination with sensors this time, and I wanted to create a stepping stone towards the next idea that can be executed in the later stages of this case study. The intention was to focus on sensors and their capabilities but there needed to be a meaningful interaction between the Wi-Fi connection and physical device. Through some testing, I discovered the possibility of making a motion sensor alarm so by pushing the testing further, this made the device worthwhile. </p>

        <h2>Ideation Stage</h2>

        <p>While coming up with meaningful ideas for this case study, there was a discovery which led into a fascination with sensors. There were many ideas that came to light but it was important to factor in the time required and the possibility of the development off the physical device. The thought that came to mind was “How can people use this?” and “how will it benefit someone’s life?” A majority of people around the world are stuck indoors, so I started exploring the possibilities with IoT coupled with the pandemic. Anything considered smart is an IoT device, so it was quite difficult to come up with an original idea. However, I find that it is better to understand the process of making this type of device than to acknowledge the item’s existence alone.</p>

        <p>As a result, due to the circumstances, I decided to go with a motion sensor that detects intruders in your bedroom. Being at home all the time would make people feel that their belongings are safe. However, we still need to leave the house just to run errands. With a device like this, I believe it would be ideal for anyone that may feel concerns about their privacy. </p>

        <h2>Things to Consider</h2>

        <p>I felt that using the feather huzzah could be challenging, but once some time was put aside to learn how to use it, really showed its use. 
            A few things that I considered during this case study:</p></div> </br> 
           <p><b> What sensors and modules are available to me?</b>
            <ul></p>
           
            <li>Ultrasonic Distance Sensor</li>
            <li>Passive Piezo-Buzzer</li>
            <li>Obstacle Detection Sensor</li>
            <li>Light Sensor</li>
            <li>PIR Motion Sensor</li>
            <li>TF-Luna 8m LiDAR Distance Sensor (delayed mail)</li>
            </ul>
           <p> All these sensors are great options where some are more reliable than others, but it is great to know that there is a huge variety of sensors out there that connect to the feather huzzah. I wanted to choose the motion sensor because it is simple to use and does what I need it to.</p>
</p>

        <p><b>Is the connection meaningful?</b></p>
           <p> I found the device I decided on needed to be something relevant, which is based on what is going on in the world during this time.</p>
</p>
    
     <p><b>How will it work?</b></p>
         <p>I found myself asking this numerous times. The way this device works is that it will detect when someone passes by it. In order for it to work properly, the person must be in the devices range. This means, the device would have to be place strategically where it can be unseen. Once the device it triggered, it sends a text message to you. At this stage, it was uncertain I the light sequence would sync up with the device.</p>

        <h2>Prototyping
        </h2>
        <p>The intention was to create a device that detects intruders in your bedroom. In doing this, it will play sounds through the passive buzzer and alert you by text message. To get to the final stage, I had to understand the functionalities of the feather huzzah, so this is where prototyping began. Through the three guides provided, there were various techniques that could be used. </p>
        
        <p>Through the Adafruit IO feed, it helped us understand how the device sends data. Instead of using a button, I had to wire in a switch; however, it gave the same results as the guides.  </p>

        <div class="col3 md3">
            </br> <p>The first step was to have an understanding of the connection between the feather huzzah and a simple circuit. After following the first test, there was a connection established, the LED was blinking in response to being connected to the wiFi. There was a discovery that others had wired their circuit differently in roder to get it to work. In this case, I made the decision to use a switch.</p>

        <div class="col3 md3">
           </br> </br> </br> <p>The second test required the serial monitor to see the functionality. By displaying 1's and 0's represented the circuit being on and off. In the video shown, I display the success with this step.</p>

        <div class="col3 md3">
            </br> <p>The last test performed was working with a P5 sketch. I found it interesting that all these steps still worked fairly well with the switch I decided to use. When the sketch is inactive and the circuit is off, the circle is smaller. Whereas, when it is turned on, the size of the circle in the sketch increases. These tests had great foundation for exploration.</p>

        <h2>The Result</h2>
           
        <center><img src="img/header2.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="800"></center>
        
        <p>The intention was to create a motion sensor device that detects when there is motion. This could have been deemed helpful for those that have to run errands and don't have a lock on their door. Even though the attempt was there, the results led in being patially unsuccessful. The device was able to react to a button press, this is what told the device to send a text whenever the button is pushed. However, with the time taken to get the device to react to motion still could not complete the circuit intended.</p>

        <p>The next step is to stick to the idea around pandemic related devices but there is defintely potential within this project. Hoepfully, in the future I can create an effective circuit for this device.</p>

        <p>Learning the feather huzzah and IoT wasn't a huge learning curve but it required some extra thinking when it came to troubleshooting. In the future, I intend to challenge myself further but it would be good to consider working in a team so the results improve. I felt accomplished in what I had managed on my own but I still want to explore more ideas that I had considered before starting this study. In the next project, I intend to be more realistic in my capabilities but there will still be obstacles put in place so I am able to learn further.</p>
